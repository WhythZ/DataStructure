Though several of them are not completed because of my lack of leisure, you can also check related notes posted on my own [blog](https://whythz.github.io/) for detailed explanations

## Using

1. Ensure that your VSCode has installed these addons: `C/C++`, `CMake`, `CMake Tools`

2. Use `Ctrl + F5` to use CMake to generate the executable file and run it
    - You can comment the unwanted test cases in `Main.cpp` to hide them
    - The data structures and algorithms' process will be visually printed in console

3. If you want to debug with gdb, follow the steps, else you can ignore this part
    - Firstly change the `"miDebuggerPath"` value in the `launch.json` to your local MinGW `gdb.exe` directory
    - Then use `Ctrl + Shift + D` and click the related button to start debugging with breakpoints
