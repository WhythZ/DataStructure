## About
This repo stores C++ implementations of common data structures and algorithms as listed below, note that the lists and trees are completed without STL

- Linear Lists
    - Sequential
    - Linked
    - Stack
    - Queue

- Tree Structures
    - Multi
        - ~~N-ary~~
        - Search
        - ~~B+~~
    - Binary
        - Search
            - ~~AVL~~
            - ~~Red-Black~~
        - ~~Heap~~

- Sorting Methods
    - $O(n^2)$
        - Selection
        - Insertion
        - Bubble
    - $O(n\ln{n})$
        - ~~Heap~~
        - ~~Merge~~
        - ~~Quick~~
    - $O(n)$
        - ~~Bucket~~
        - ~~Radix~~

Though several of them are not completed because of my lack of leisure, you can also check related notes posted on my own [blog](https://whythz.github.io/) for detailed explanations

## Using

1. Ensure that your VSCode has installed these addons: `C/C++`, `CMake`, `CMake Tools`

2. Use `Ctrl + F5` to use CMake to generate the executable file and run it
    - You can comment the unwanted test cases in `Main.cpp` to hide them
    - Test functions of the lists and trees will print related information in the console lines
    - SDL2 Libraries are used to visualize the processes of how the sorting algorithms work

3. If you want to debug with gdb, follow the steps, else you can ignore this part
    - Firstly change the `"miDebuggerPath"` value in the `launch.json` to your local MinGW `gdb.exe` directory
    - Then use `Ctrl + Shift + D` and click the related button to start debugging with breakpoints
