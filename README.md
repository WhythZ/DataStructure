## About
This repo stores C++ implementations of common data structures and algorithms as listed below, note that the lists and trees are completed without STL

- Linear Lists
    - Sequential
    - Linked
    - Stack
    - Queue

- Tree Structures
    - Multi
        - ~~N-ary~~
        - Search
        - ~~B+~~
    - Binary
        - Search
            - ~~AVL~~
            - ~~Red-Black~~
        - ~~Heap~~

- Sorting Methods
    - $O(n^2)$
        - Selection
        - Insertion
        - Bubble
    - $O(n\ln{n})$
        - ~~Heap~~
        - ~~Merge~~
        - ~~Quick~~
    - $O(n)$
        - ~~Bucket~~
        - ~~Radix~~

Though several of them are not completed because of my lack of leisure, you can also check related notes posted on my own [blog](https://whythz.github.io/) for detailed explanations

## Using

Several test cases are prepared, you can directly run the `Main.cpp` in `Codes` folder to call all the test functions for partcular data structures and algorithms, just comment the unwanted ones in the `main()` function to hide them

- Test functions of the lists and trees will print related information in the console lines
- SDL2 Libraries are used to visualize the processes of how the sorting algorithms work
