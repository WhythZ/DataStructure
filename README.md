Though several of them are not completed because of my lack of leisure, you can also check related notes posted on my own [blog](https://whythz.github.io/) for detailed explanations

## Deployment
- Ensure that your VSCode has installed these addons: `C/C++`, `CMake`, `CMake Tools`, then clone this repo and open it in VSCode

```
git clone https://github.com/WhythZ/DataStructure.git
```

- Use `Ctrl + Shift + P` and then find `CMake: Configure`, choose your local compiler such as gcc from MinGW, then create `build` folder in root directory, `cd build` enter it in terminal, use instructions below to generate Makefiles

```
cmake -G"MinGW Makefiles" ..
```

- Then use following command to compile all the codes for the first time or after whenever you edit the codes

```
cmake --build .
```

- After that you can use `Ctrl + F5` to run the executable file to print the running process of the test cases visually in console, by the way if you want to debug the codes with gdb
    - Change the `"miDebuggerPath"` value in the `launch.json` to your local MinGW `gdb.exe` directory
    - Then use `Ctrl + Shift + D` and click the related button to start debugging with debug tools like breakpoints
